## We are Wunder

These are the values that make us who we are. They push us to be better and to achieve our goals.

## We are Open

We push openness and transparency to new extremes. Everything we create is open by default. We are highly collaborative and work easily and often with others, including our clients, open source communities, and other firms in our industry. We share our knowledge and experience widely. We're great listeners, curious and always open to ideas and feedback. We communicate clearly and often.

## We are Professional

We work hard to build and maintain trust with our clients. We're always learning from others and from experimentation, bringing credible expertise to our work. We support each other as a team. We can always be relied on to deliver. We're respected for the ways in which we work.

> We always aim to deliver great, influential projects that we're proud of. For example, we developed a reusable web platform for the Estonian government.

## We are Healthy

We favour long-term sustainable success over short term benefits. We do what's right for our clients and what's right for each other. We value diversity, individuality and weirdness. We have fun, are happy, and bring fun and happiness to others too. We support each other. We have a healthy attitude to failure, facing up to it, learning from our mistakes and avoiding blame. We work in healthy ways, to support a high quality of life. We value being a healthy sustainable company.

> We help each other to improve professionally, but also personally. Staying fit, eating healthy, and spending good time with family and friends. We share ideas, advice, and show off our achievements.

## We are Fluid

We are flexible and adaptable in the way we work, the way we learn, the way we think, and the way we are structured. We encourage and accept change. We're agile in the way we deliver. We work in borderless ways â€” as one team in the company, and one team with client organisations.

> Our initiative teams are a great example of being flexible and agile. Anyone in the group can suggest an initiative, put a team together, and change the way we work.

## We are Leaders

We lead as an organisation, with clients and communities valuing and adopting our ideas and practices. We lead as individuals, operating as a do-ocracy where any team member can step up to lead on initiatives and projects, in the company and in our communities. Our leadership style is consultative but decisive, with a bias for action. We aim to inspire and enthuse, and lead by example.

> I'm proud of how we've openly and actively helped other companies in our industry to improve. A smaller agency in the UK won their first really big project and contacted me for advice on what to do about enterprise level contracts. I shared our template contract with them.
